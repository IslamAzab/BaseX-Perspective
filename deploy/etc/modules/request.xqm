 : This <a href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Module_Library">XQuery Module</a> contains functions for retrieving information on an HTTP request that has triggered the query. It is mainly useful in the context of <a href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Web_Application">Web Applications</a> . The module is mainly derived from Adam Retterâ€™s upcoming <a href="http://exquery.github.com/expath-specs-playground/request-module-1.0-specification.html">EXQuery Request Module</a> .
